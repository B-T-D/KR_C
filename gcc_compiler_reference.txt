$ gcc -o output_name c_file_to_compile.c

Putting int before main() definition resolves the "return type defaults to 'int'" warning (K&R C's examples don't have this because of changes to C / the compiler since then):
	int main()
	{ 
		foo();
	}

List local paths to source code of all header files in a given .c source code file:
$ gcc -H my_c_filename.c

Limit compiler-warning output to syntax errors:
$ gcc <some command> -fsyntax-only

Inhibit all warning messages:
	-w
