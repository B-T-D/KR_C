$ gcc -o output_name c_file_to_compile.c

Putting int before main() definition resolves the "return type defaults to 'int'" warning (K&R C's examples don't have this because of changes to C / the compiler since then):
	int main()
	{ 
		foo();
	}

List local paths to source code of all header files in a given .c source code file:
$ gcc -H my_c_filename.c

Limit compiler-warning output to syntax errors:
$ gcc <some command> -fsyntax-only

Inhibit all warning messages:
	-w

--Examining the .out file--

View a representation of the machine-code instructions in an .out file created by the compiler:
	$ hexdump -C myfile
		- Doesn't need an extension in the command line
		- This is a Linux command not actually anything to do with gcc compiler syntax

Pure binary with instruction-numbers in hex:
	$ xxd -b myfile

Hex:
	$ xxd myfile
	
Assembler code:
	$ objdump -d myfile
